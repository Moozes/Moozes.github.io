This is the first project to do when learning a new technology, because it helps you familiarize with CRUD operations which is present almost in every web application,
this app started simple where it had only add and delete operations, then with time i added other features like
edit, filter but todo status (All, active, or completed), and Delete all completed todos
because user feedback is always important, they always need to understand what is happening, dont freeze the interface and expect them to understand what is going on

This is the first project to do when learning a new technology, because it helps you familiarize with *CRUD operations which is present almost in every web application, this app started simple where it had only *add and *delete operations, then with time i added other features like *edit, *filter by todo status (All, active, or completed), and *Delete all completed todos, and because *user feedback is always important, i added a feedback message component that appears to confirm that the action taken by the user was successful.
